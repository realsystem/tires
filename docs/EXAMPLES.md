3. **Wheels**:
   - Stock TRD wheels work
   - Or upgrade to 0 to +10mm offset for better clearance
   - No spacers required

**Why 3.909 Gears are Great**:
- Middle ground between 3.73 (economy) and 4.10 (performance)
- Better highway RPM than 4.10 (fuel economy)
- Stronger acceleration than 3.73 (loaded performance)
- Ideal for overlanding with gear + roof tent

**Air-Down Guide**:
- Street: 35 PSI
- Dirt roads: 30 PSI
- Trail: 22-26 PSI
- Rock crawling: 15-18 PSI (monitor sidewall flex)

**Warnings**:
- ⚠️ IFS CV angles will increase slightly - monitor for clicking
- ⚠️ Fuel economy may drop 0.5-1 MPG (minimal due to low diameter increase)
- ⚠️ Speedometer will read 2.3 mph slow at 60 mph (minor, but note for tickets)

**Real-World Experience**:
This is one of the best "stealth" upgrades for a Tacoma TRD. The 3.909 gears are already fairly aggressive, so the 285/75R17 tire sits perfectly in the sweet spot. You get:
- Improved ground clearance
- Better tire footprint off-road
- Minimal performance loss
- No re-gear needed
- Fits with moderate lift

**Total Cost**:
- Tires (5 with spare): $1,500 - $1,800
- Lift kit (2"): $600 - $900
- Wheels (optional): $800 - $1,200
- Installation/alignment: $300 - $500
- **Total: $2,400 - $3,200** (without wheels)
- **Total: $3,200 - $4,400** (with wheels)

**Perfect for**: Daily driver that sees weekend trails, light overlanding, forest service roads, occasional rock crawling.

**Verdict**: The 3.909 gear ratio is a hidden gem. Combined with 285/75R17 tires, you get a capable off-road setup without the need for expensive re-gearing. This is the most cost-effective Tacoma upgrade.
