# Toyota Tacoma 3.909 Gear Ratio - Complete Guide

The **3.909 axle gear ratio** is Toyota's best-kept secret for the Tacoma TRD Off-Road. This comprehensive guide explains why it's the sweet spot for off-road builds.

---

## What is the 3.909 Gear Ratio?

The 3.909 differential gear ratio is a factory option found in:
- **2016-2023 Tacoma TRD Off-Road** (3rd gen, V6 with 6-speed automatic transmission)
- **2024+ Tacoma** (4th gen, select packages and configurations)
- **Some 2023+ TRD Sport** models

It sits between the economy-focused 3.73 and the performance-oriented 4.10, providing the best of both worlds.

## Why 3.909 is Special

### The Sweet Spot

| Aspect | 3.73 Gears | **3.909 Gears** | 4.10 Gears |
|--------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Acceleration** | Weak | **Good** | Best |
| **Highway RPM** | Lowest | **Balanced** | Higher |
| **Fuel Economy** | Best | **Very Good** | Good |
| **Max tire (no regear)** | 275/70R17 | **285/75R17** | 33x10.50R17 |
| **Loaded performance** | Struggles | **Handles well** | Excellent |
| **Crawl ratio (stock)** | 33.8:1 | **35.4:1** | 37.1:1 |

**Verdict**: 3.909 gives you 90% of 4.10's performance with 90% of 3.73's fuel economy.

## Perfect Tire Size: 285/75R17

The **285/75R17** tire is the ideal match for 3.909 gears:

### Stock vs Upgrade Comparison

| Metric | Stock (265/70R17) | Upgrade (285/75R17) | Change |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Diameter** | 31.6" | 32.8" | +1.2" (+3.8%) |
| **Width** | 10.4" | 11.2" | +0.8" |
| **Ground Clearance** | Stock | +0.6" | Gain |
| **RPM @ 65 mph** | 1,959 | 1,888 | -71 RPM |
| **Effective gear ratio** | 3.909 | 3.77 | -3.5% |

### Why This Combo Works

1. **Minimal Diameter Increase** (3.8%)
   - Small enough to avoid re-gearing
   - Large enough to improve capability
   - Perfect balance

2. **RPM Still Good** (1,888 @ 65 mph)
   - Not too high (avoids buzzy highway driving)
   - Not too low (maintains passing power)
   - Fuel economy barely affected

3. **Performance Loss Minimal**
   - 3.5% effective ratio reduction
   - Barely noticeable in normal driving
   - Loaded with gear: still pulls strong

4. **Crawl Ratio Acceptable** (34.1:1)
   - Down from 35.4:1 stock
   - Still good for technical terrain
   - Fine for 95% of trails

## RPM Comparison Table

**At 65 mph highway cruise** (6AT with 0.84 overdrive):

| Tire Size | 3.73 Gears | **3.909 Gears** | 4.10 Gears | 4.30 Gears |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| 265/70R17 (stock) | 1,874 | **1,959** | 2,059 | 2,160 |
| 275/70R17 | 1,838 | **1,922** | 2,019 | 2,119 |
| **285/75R17** | **1,806** | **1,888** | **1,980** | **2,077** |
| 33x10.50R17 | 1,792 | 1,873 | 1,967 | 2,064 |

**Ideal RPM Range**: 1,850-2,100 (highlighted in bold are good ranges)

**Analysis**:
- **3.73** with 285/75R17 = 1,806 RPM (too low, sluggish)
- **3.909** with 285/75R17 = 1,888 RPM (perfect sweet spot)
- **4.10** with 285/75R17 = 1,980 RPM (also good, slightly higher)
- **4.30** with 285/75R17 = 2,077 RPM (high but good for loaded/towing)
