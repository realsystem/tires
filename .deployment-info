=====================================
KEY LEARNINGS
=====================================

1. **Trim Matters**
   - Same model year, different trims = different tires
   - SR5 ≠ TRD Sport ≠ TRD Off-Road ≠ TRD Pro
   - Each needs separate database entry

2. **Wheel Size Matters**
   - Bronco Base: 16" wheels (255/70R16)
   - Bronco Big Bend: 17" wheels (255/75R17)
   - Same vehicle, different packages!

3. **Generational Differences**
   - JK Wrangler (2007-2018) ≠ JL Wrangler (2018+)
   - JL Sport uses smaller 245/75R17
   - JL Sahara uses 255/70R18 or 255/75R17

4. **Don't Combine Unless Identical**
   - Previous: "SR5/TRD Sport" combined
   - Problem: Different tire sizes (245/75R16 vs 265/65R17)
   - Solution: Separate entries for accuracy

=====================================
